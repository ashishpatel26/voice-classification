First look at the "How to Run" document posted. If you still have questions message me (Hamza Ghani) on LinkedIn if there are any questions. Code is disorganized but happy to set some time and walk anyone interested through it. 

I've been busy with other ventures and work. Someone linked me to this project which seems much better organized: https://github.com/philipperemy/deep-speaker
(I have no affiliation or endorsement of the linked project)
